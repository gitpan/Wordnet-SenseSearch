Wordnet-SenseSearch version 0.02
================================

This is a very simple module with little functionality. I don't have time to 
extend it, but was surprised to find no Perl Wordnet interfaces (to my 
knowledge) that use a binary search to lookup index entries (as opposed to 
loading the entire indexes into memory). So please email me if you want to 
take this over, or better yet, adopt the Search::Dict technique shown here 
in other Wordnet interfaces. This kind of lookup is plenty fast for most 
applications.

This module provides only one method, which takes a sense key and returns data 
for the identified synset.

INSTALLATION

You need the Wordnet files; change the path in lib/Wordnet/SenseSearch.pm to
match the directory containing your data/index files.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
